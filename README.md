# Assembler

These are a few scripts to assemble individual Markdown files and export them to Word using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). I made them in a few minutes to help speed up my writing workflow.

Use `./config` for setting your assignment/paper name.

Use `./assemble` to assemble your files into one Markdown file.  
_Note: this takes all .md files in the current folder. I would recommend naming them with numbers at the beginning, e.g. 00-introduction.md, 01-body.md, etc._

Use `./export` to make a Word document.  
_Note: this does re-assemble too._
